widgetTitle:
  'Slideshow or lightbox galleries'

# Two galleries and the need for a pl-galleries template is so a style guide user can toggle between gallery types. !!!!! NOTE: In order for slick to calculate the height of the first image correctly, the slider must always be the first gallery and only the first gallery should have a gallery titleâ€”if used. !!!!!!
