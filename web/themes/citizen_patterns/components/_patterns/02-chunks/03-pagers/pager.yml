# if using a smart pager (set in 00-base/macros.twig), having more than 7 pages will display the extended version of the smart pager, having less than 7 will display the short version. When smart pagers are in play, you MUST include results-count and count-shim span in each views results footer in Drupal and the full pager type must be set.
