## ABOUT CITIZEN PATTERNS THEME

Citizen Patterns is an Atomic design based Pattern Lab theme by Electric Citizen, http://www.electriccitizen.com. 

For Drupal 9, Citizen Patterns uses Emulsify by Four Kitchens as a starting place. The Emulsify Gulp npm package is a dependency of the Citizen Patterns theme.

Pattern Lab can be deployed as a living styleguide by running ```npm run deploy```. This will build a /build folder in the theme root (if you get an error about /build not existing just run again) and deploy that folder to the gh-pages branch of the project repo. If no gh-pages branch exists, it will create one. You can then view the living style guide on this url: https://electriccitizen.github.io/< my project >/pattern-lab/public. For production sites, a custom url should be used: https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site


## GETTING STARTED

Working with Citizen Patterns requires a few things: 

To get started:
(a) get a local site instance spun up following the instructions in the site repo.
(b) Make sure you have node and npm installed globally and that you are using the correct versions of Node and NPM outlined by the note in the last reviewed section of this doc. 
(d) cd into the folder for citizen_patterns
(e) run: 
```
npm install
```

Working: 
(a) cd into the citizen_patterns folder
(b) run: 
```
npm start
```

-- This will trigger a few things: Scss files will be linted and compiled, Twig files will be linted, and a local Pattern Lab instance will be opened in Google Chrome.

Other notes:
-- theme tasks are all run by the npm start script defined in package.json. New tasks can be added to that script and existing tasks defined in that script can be customized in local.gulp-config.js.


## PATTERN LAB
All Pattern Lab top-level folders can be renamed except the 00-base folder. Pattern Lab will die and the theme will not compile anything without 00-base. If folders are renamed make sure the libraries.yml, styles.scss, components section of .info.yml, Pattern Lab .md files and all inherited twig file paths are a updated accordingly.

The styleguide main header is set in 00-base/base.md and the main section titles are set in .md files inside each top level folder.

The theme currently has issues with JS in Pattern Lab. For some reason, getting JS files from the theme into a place where Pattern Lab can read them both locally and post-deploy is trickyâ€”especially since we don't want every JS file in the theme to be used in Pattern Lab. For this reason, currently any JS you do want to work in Pattern Lab must be manually added to the styleguide.js file in ./components/js. To see it in PL locally, run ```npm run jsRefresh``` and refresh your browser tab. To get it to the living styleguide run ```npm run deploy```.
