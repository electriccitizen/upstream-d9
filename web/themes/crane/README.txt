ABOUT CRANE THEME
------------

Crane is an minimal Drupal 8 administration theme by Electric Citizen, http://www.electriccitizen.com. 

Crane uses Seven as its base them. The idea of Crane is to make things as clear and simple for the editor as possible.


GETTING STARTED
--------------------

Working with Crane requires a few things: 
(a) working knowledge of Sass, Twig, Jquery
(c) use of the command line (e.g. Terminal) and a good IDE (e.g. Sublime Text)

To get started:
(a) get a local site instance spun up following the virtual machine on boarding section of the site repo.
(b) Make sure you have npm installed globally and that you are using version 6 or later. You can check this by running: npm -v in any command line window.
(c) Make sure you have node installed globally and that you are using version 11 or later. You can check this by running: npm -v in any command line window.
(d) cd into the folder for Crane in the command line
(e) run: npm install

Working: 
(a) cd into the Crane folder in the command line
(b) run: npm start

NPM Start will trigger a gulp-based watch command that watches all Sass (.scss) files in the /scss folder and rebuilds the css and css.map files on each change.
